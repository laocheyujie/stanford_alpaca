In contrast, the North's land was evenly divided and mainly focused on livestock and dairy farming, while in the South, the land was concentrated on producing cash crops, such as cotton, sugar, and tobacco. The North also had more industrial farming, such as wheat production, while the South focused more on subsistence farming. The North also had higher literacy rates, better access to infrastructure and resources, and there was less exploitation of labor by landlords. In conclusion, while both n regional systems of agriculture had their downsides and upsides, the North's was largely seen as being more progressive compared to the South's traditional plantation-style system.",

In turn, when our friends are in need, it gives us the opportunity to support them and be a part of their journeys.\n\nHaving a strong group of friends encourages us to be more open and emotionally express ourselves. We learn valuable life lessons such as trust, loyalty and understanding, which can be invaluable skills in our daily interactions. Friends are the people who are always with us without judgement, encouraging us to try new things and to broaden our knowledge.\n\nWe need friendships in our lives because they can be the spark that ignites a deep sense of belonging, purpose, and joy.

Upon returning to India he launched civil disobedience campaigns against unjust laws and was jailed several times for his activities.\n\nGandhi developed his philosophy of non-violence, which he called Satyagraha, and applied it to his peaceful resistance against oppressive government policies. He also promoted an Indian form of self-sufficiency and political freedom, using in part the teaching of poverty-relief programmes such as spinning wheels to create homespun cloth. He became a figurehead and leader of the Indian nationalist movement and was soon recognised as \u2018Mahatma\u2019, meaning Great Soul or exemplar of virtue.\n\nGandhi\u2019s influence was spread throughout India and beyond as he led hundreds of civil rights campaigns and inspired generations with his philosophy of non-violence, free expression and religious harmony. As India moved closer to independence, religious tensions began to mount and he was assassinated in 1948. His legacy is enduring and his teachings are still remembered and revered throughout the world.",
